# What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging part was ensuring that the website was both functional and visually appealing across different screen sizes. Balancing the layout for desktop and mobile views required careful use of CSS media queries and flexbox/grid layouts. It was also a challenge to maintain consistency in design elements while incorporating responsive behavior.
I found working with HTML and CSS to be a mix of both easy and challenging. The basic structure and styling were straightforward, but making the site fully responsive and ensuring that all elements worked well together on various devices required more in-depth adjustments and testing.
Overall, this assignment took about 16 hours to complete. This included the time spent on planning, writing HTML/CSS, testing responsiveness, and refining the design.

# What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile-friendly?

To make the site mobile-friendly, I decided to implement media queries that adjust the layout based on screen size. For example, I ensured that the navigation menu stacks vertically on smaller screens and that text and images scale appropriately. I also used a grid system that adapts from multiple columns to a single column on mobile devices, improving readability and navigation.

# What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?

When designing the website, I focused on creating a clean, professional, and user-friendly interface. I considered factors such as readability, simplicity, and ease of navigation. I also aimed to use a consistent color scheme and font choices to ensure a cohesive look throughout the site. One aspect I’m particularly proud of is the smooth transitions and hover effects, which add interactivity without overwhelming the user.
I’m especially proud of the responsiveness and the overall layout of the site. The grid-based design and subtle animations (like hover effects) help to create a polished experience across devices.

# Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?
With more time or resources, I would add interactive features such as a dynamic blog with search and filter options, a portfolio gallery with sorting capabilities, and possibly integrating some back-end functionality for user feedback or contact forms. I would also consider improving accessibility by adding keyboard navigation support and enhanced screen reader compatibility.

# How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent about 16 hours on this assignment.

# (Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they? If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here.Furthermore, if you imported a file to use a Fonts or Icons library, please indicate that here as well.
I assumed that the focus was primarily on the front-end design and responsiveness rather than back-end functionality or database integration. Therefore, I concentrated on making the site visually appealing and user-friendly.

For this project, I used the Google Fonts library for typography and Font Awesome for the icons. Additionally, I referred to a few online resources for CSS grid and flexbox techniques to ensure responsive design.
